// playing with c++20 coroutines
// coroutines are essentially routines which may be suspended and resumed
// at a later point in time. this is achieved simply by decoupling the
// execution of the routine from the stack onto dynamic memory. this allows
// the ability to save the state of the coroutine without tampering with
// the ordering of the stack.
